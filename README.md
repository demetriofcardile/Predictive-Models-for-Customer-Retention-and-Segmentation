# Predictive Models for Customer Retention and Segmentation
This project involves analyzing bank account data to predict whether customers will close their credit card accounts. By leveraging classification methods (particularly gradient boosting ones), and clustering techniques such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, the goal is to develop models that help the bank retain customers by proposing suitable services. The project also includes a secondary analysis of purchase data to identify customer segments with similar purchasing behaviors.

Notice that this project has been developed together with other two collaborators (and fellow colleagues) as a group-project for a BSc Course in Data Analysis for Business.
